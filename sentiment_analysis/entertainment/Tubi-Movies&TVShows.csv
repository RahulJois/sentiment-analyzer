As often occurs with Netflix, I'll go back to watch one again latter on and poof, it's gone. You'll find a lot of movies here that I suppose Netflix thinks are not worth having around. OK so there's commercials. They're repetitive. So what? That's how these folks pay their bills because YOU'RE NOT! Meaning it's a free service for you. So complaining about commercials is a moot point. Besides, commercials can be good for you. Sometimes  breaks are required during movies. Suggestions for future updates? Great app, there are a lot of movies here already, but you need more titles and there are many more to be had.

The other issue is to do with chrome cast, subtitles appear in the left hand corner instead of the center.  It also doesn't load subtitles fast enough a lot of the time.

The choices in movies and TV are great, and I love the fact that closed captions are there for the hearing impaired. Great thumbs up from me. I hope they continue doing a great job, because its nice having access to viewing movies and TV on the go. It's not always easy finding one with captions readily available and a good clear viewing of your favorites. Again, great job.",5,positive
