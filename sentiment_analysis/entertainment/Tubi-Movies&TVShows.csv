As often occurs with Netflix, I'll go back to watch one again latter on and poof, it's gone. You'll find a lot of movies here that I suppose Netflix thinks are not worth having around. OK so there's commercials. They're repetitive. So what? That's how these folks pay their bills because YOU'RE NOT! Meaning it's a free service for you. So complaining about commercials is a moot point. Besides, commercials can be good for you. Sometimes  breaks are required during movies. Suggestions for future updates? Great app, there are a lot of movies here already, but you need more titles and there are many more to be had.

The choices in movies and TV are great, and I love the fact that closed captions are there for the hearing impaired. Great thumbs up from me.
