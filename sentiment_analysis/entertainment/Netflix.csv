1,65f5a295-2a5e-48e6-b7b4-fc6ca45cbf8d,Can't exit the application by simply pressing the Back button. You need to dive into an endless navigation through the menu to find and press the exit button. Just terrible! It makes me want to leave Netflix and spend my money elsewhere.,1,negative

3,6894994d-b8af-4b2c-b4bc-05ade9d7bdea,This app needs to updated to work with Android Marshmallow. Videos won't load but audio starts when a bluetooth headset is connected. Subtitles are cut off on left side whenever there is 2 or more lines. Will edit rating once bugs are fixed.,1,negative

Had to delete and completely re-install. Since voice input doesn't work, and using your phone as a keyboard also doesn't work... making it a pain for entering passwords. Subtitles also don't work well. Text styling doesn't work, and the subtitles are always white.   Can't have separate passwords for profiles which kind of defeats the purpose it's common for people to be too lazy to change to their own profile.   Video occasionally stutters in the beginning, and the first part of the movie is usually low quality. Though it only happens about the first 10 seconds or so.  Suggestions don't show up in the home screen. Would be really nice to have at least last watched, my list, and  suggestion card on the home screen. Netflix really dropped the ball on this one.",2,negative
