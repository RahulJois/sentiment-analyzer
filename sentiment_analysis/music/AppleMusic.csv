Being a classical music lover the information display for tracks is nearly always showing the least important details making navigation between various movements a frustratingly random leap in the dark. The developers of this software need to seriously consider the user-friendliness because, as it stands, this app is user-hostile and counter-intuitive.",1,negative

App crashes periodically, and it somehow became harder to use gesture like swipes to play next/add music/delete. If you add music to play next while a song is playing, with a chance of 50/50 it is going to skip those songs and play the previously set ""next song"".

The best Android apps rely on SIDE MENUS; not Apple's style of having buttons along the bottom row - which bring us to pages with buttons across the top of the screen, which then lead to pages with tile-layout icons, which have no reorganize-as-list option. I know this is Apple's design language, but it just requires MORE taps across FARTHER areas to navigate & search artists & songs. It's even worse on large-screen tablets.",2,negative

There are seemingly no folders for playlists, which makes navigation a nightmare if you have more than 5 or 6 playlists... Especially on Android Auto.

232,c54c08b7-ad29-4d11-bd7e-2dd2f5892b64,"This app sucks!! Very buggy. A transfer message pops up every 2 seconds & I have to hit ok. What is this? Also was charged $9.99 on my amex card after I signed up for free 3 month trial. I guess it's ok to rob us blind, huh?",1,negative
233,d3f2a7bd-e734-49ee-a77d-b881bc2da953,"The design is fairly easy to use, navigation simple. The interface imo is appealing. There are a few significant usability issues though. First is exploring the library. It is easy for my own music, artist, album, genres. However the online library seems to only be accessed via a simple search and added to a playlist or through a limited 'we pick for you' page an 'new' page. Another major gap is using an SD card. These and working family sharing need corrected to recommend this app.",3,negative

235,75db5ef9-94e8-4e5f-96ef-3b8fbc268331,"It is a great idea to bring this to android!   But, why do I need to give my credit card information for a trail?  And why can't I download music to my sd card?   The app is sluggish, navigation is a disaster (the hamburger menu isn't accessible from everywhere, just from the homepage, there where you need it the least).  It doesn't look as good as Google play music.  The menu key next to songs should do what it does in your app.  There is also many many content missing compared to Google play music. For half of he artists I checked, at least 2/3 of their songs/albums is missing. I really like the the transparent status bar, which you added at places where GPM chose to don't add it. There are many things to improve.   I like play music better for now.",2,negative
236,065224a1-c7f7-4b9d-b450-649eb67d810a,"Navigation is awkward and complicated. I don't need emphasis in discovering, radio and that stuff. Most of the times I just want to navigate through my music in a simple way. Now I have tons of buttons and online suggestion that I simply don't want. My music does not feel my music anymore...  But is a great product though.",3,negative
237,8db55922-5b07-434b-b15e-7c5067fa1c33,"First things first... Apple Music on Mac is a great buy... Just amazing collection on apple at your fingers reach...secondly those who say it doesn't work in India, pls check again... I just downloaded it and signed in with my apple user id... My entire collection is now on my android without having to buy an iPhone... Wow guys... Just loved the user accessibility on android for my Mac.. Love you guys... Keep it up... Five stars for you",5,positive
238,1c944825-effc-4116-9ded-3ddf1f9b7add,Working great for the most part.  There are however a few bugs such as the album art disappearing in notification panel. Would recommend a widget be added in future update for easier accessibility.,4,positive
239,4e6ba98d-2272-4717-bbab-38c755718874,I don't know what everyone else is complaining about as far as navigation problems. My brain works for the most part so it is easy to figure out to me. It's working perfectly on my phone.,5,positive
240,a495655c-5ff1-4b44-8079-16e86a9833c7,So far so good...just keep it up and do something about the navigation is a bit too confusing!,4,positive
241,e8e131d4-b2bd-41dd-8d38-74c89fe4dbc0,"Don't like the UI. It's some mix of iOS and Material Design that does look awful. Why not fully materialized? But that would contrast the purpose of this app: making the android user get used to the iOS design pattern and maybe make him move to iOS. Apart from that, no one needs yet another music streaming service. There's Spotify. There's Play Music. there's Deezer. And there are tons of other services. And Apple Music has nothing to make itself stand out from those masses...",2,negative
