This app now deserves the 5 star rating more than anything!  ------------- OLD REVIEW, NO LONGER RELEVANT!!!  After a long time with SoundCloud and the corresponding app itself, I finally came to a conclusion. SoundCloud itself is amazing; really nice layout, cool artists and overall a great experience, but the app... Oh boy, the app. As far as I remember, the app was really good in its first iteration. Responsive, easy enough to use and really nice interface. At some point they decided to redesign it, it's been a few years back now, and since then, the performance has been abysmal, regardless of the device. It's unresponsive when you tap, takes forever to load even the basic ui and just sucks in almost every aspect. I would like to listen to the tracks I liked via the SoundCloud app, but instead it's much more convenient to just download them and then play them back on your stock music app. Furthermore, the suggestion for similar music is so bad, it made me cringe. Even for single songs you like sometimes the suggestions are so terrible, that I actually stopped listening to any music all together for a day or two, which is basically not me at all, I listen to music constantly. Lastly, the navigation in the app itself is total bonkers. Uploads get grouped together with reposts, the playlist, that has been added to only desolation new uploads only goes so far, you cannot quick scroll and you have no search suggestions or corrections. I don't expect them to fix anything at this point, I've lost all hope. Bottom line: SoundCloud is really really good, the app really really sucks.  The app is so terrible, that I think amateurs programmed it. It can't be, that a company with the skills to create such a functional music streaming site chuck out such a abysmal piece of garbage. This literally is the worst app on my phone, regarding performance, and it's not even a game. This is completely unacceptable.  If the Devs are reading this; you have to do only one thing to improve the app: make it more responsive. Like, way more responsive. I don't care if loading a song takes ages (which it sometimes does) but in the meantime let me use the goddamn app. It's really frustrating to switch to the next song only to hear 5, sometimes 15 to 20 (!) Seconds of silence because loading and the app appears frozen until it's done. This is really pathetic, fix this thing already, if you're forcing people to sign up.",5,negative

It would be cool if it was similar to Google play music in that you could remove songs from the queue, set specific tracks to ""play next"" or ""add to queue"" instead. Also thanks for fixing the random tracks that won't play on Chromecast thing. Might also pay to add a specific ""repost to SoundCloud"" button or something when listening to a track as it'll result in overall easier more accessible way to repost as opposed to having to go into the three dots and then reposting.
