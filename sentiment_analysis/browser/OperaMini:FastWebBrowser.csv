I have always used Opera mini for years, right from the days when Java phones rained. I carried this love to Blackberry, and now to Android. All these while Opera mini has served me well and made my access to the Web very suiting. Unfortunately, these days the company has been doing things in contrast to the way it does things before. This app is being moulded into a standard browser like Chrome, Firefox, etc. Although, this will be considered improvement by some people, but honestly it's not. People who have been using Opera mini for years will understand this. The plain 'Opera' is the variant for people who want a standard Web browser, while the mini Opera, 'Opera mini' is for people who do not need anything other than the information on a website. My 'Opera mini' is now almost the same as the standard 'Opera' I have on my phone. It's now sluggish, it has a longer response time, at times my phone heats up when I open too many tabs. Can't we just make the mini stick, let's stick to mini. We already have the standard Opera, then why make mini as well standard?",2,negative

Its OK when you are using this app on a 4inch screen but it becomes a problem when you are on 5inch screen phone or above, could you put the refresh button down on the bottom navigation key? and please add option of hiding navigation bar. Good work Opera",4,negative
