511,b12867a9-f8ad-49c0-b77d-d02c028bf78d,"I am a Samsung fanboy from the day I start using Android. I want Samsung to be the best. Samsung apps are doing great in the market like S health, note, pen up,  VPN,  and many more. But when it comes to the browser I use UCBrowser because it's more user-friendly compared to other browsers even the Chrome. Multi-Task, multi-tabs should be easily accessible it's hard to open one date to another tab. If you want to be the one then work on your User experience it should be simple and better you can add like a VPN, Different extensions in your browser. Menu, settings icon should be on the bottom side. It's hard to reach the top. I appreciate Samsung browser has shortcut Like night mode and others. The appearance of Samsung browser should be more cartoons and colorful as Samsung experience. It should be made for mobile users not for desktop user as Uc Browser. I hope you would do that.",3,positive
512,858f508f-8bf0-4a11-be6f-8c7c266470d9,I've gone from chrome to this browser because Google are too nosy for me and lots of others from what I've read. I don't download much but I do browse alot and so what I miss most is SPELL CHECKING/AUTO REPLACE line. I've have disability in my hands so I struggle constantly with the small phone and tablet keyboard so spelling and auto replace was amazing for me. Instead the search words I end up with then end up with more options as the browser is trying to figure it out! I only used chrome for that reason. I really like how far Samsung browser has come tho so please PLEASE make it better with spell/auto word replace so peeps like me don't have to keep backspacing every other letter before I can successfully browse to my target! Then I'll give y'all 5 stars!,3,negative

And if I accessed a sub-folder, chose a bookmark, and then realized it wasn't the one I wanted, I can't just click the tab and be back where I was. It takes me all the way back to the bookmarks menu.
