7,d6107477-669b-44d8-afcc-72428f6b42bc,I have placed return request since December but the orders have not been picked up till now. The return pickup dates either keep changing or gets cancelled. This is really unprofessional and has caused great inconvenience to me. I want Myntra to look into this matter immediately. If this doesn't get solved asap then I'll have to reconsider shopping from Myntra ever. And to add to this...the help centre is not accessible.,1,negative

14,226caff2-c3a8-4328-bd83-880f6d617dbd,"This app is the worst. The products are, no doubt, good but you need to have a proper customer care service. i have been facing an issue but literally there is no response from their side and i cannot contact the customer care. this app is a complete trash. once you get the product, they wont even try to resolve your query. Improve your customer care service and make it accessible 24/7",1,negative
