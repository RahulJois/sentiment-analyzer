Hey there everyone I'm back to do an update on shopping with Wish . Due to me being on disability I am so glad that I downloaded Wish app because I can afford most of the idems and if the idem isn't what I was expecting and I wasn't happy about the idem Wish made it right.

app. This does not seem to be the case. When opening the app for the first 
time it told me to pick a Free gift from various items, several labelled to 
be originally $20+ or even $30 in value. I figured this was a nice gesture 
some of the items in the pictures looked to be pretty decent quality. I 
fell for the trick, picked an item I would not normally purchase, and was 
charged $4 for shipping and handling despite telling me it would be $2 for 
shipping and handling. There was no confirmation page, just straight to 
receipt. Come to find out this item was already priced at $2 or 3 to begin 
with and was shipping from China, which was estimated up to 2 months! Lol. 
Had I known this I definitely wouldn't have ordered. I immediately 
requested to cancel the ""Gotcha"" order but no one responded. I sent another 
message to customer service and a few days later they responded and said I 
wouldn't be able to cancel. I replied and no response. It's been about 50 
days and still haven't received the item and they will not honer their 
""guarantee."" I'm pretty sure this app comes with spyware as well and there 
are a lot of ads. Again, this was a junky chinse metal wallet style 
knockoff product that I would never even think about buying if I knew more 
about it. I was never able to see the actual price or details until the 
""gift"" purchase went through. If they don't offer a free return or refund 
(if it ever comes), I will certainly delete this app and leave this 1 star 
review for other people to be aware of the gimmick. I see where the name 
comes from now. You'll ""wish"" you hadn't wasted your time and downloaded 
this sketchy app to begin with and you can't help but feel like your phone 
is infected with some malware after seeing all the ads and desperate 
attempts to lure you into giving them information to ""register"" and accept

462,17618e60-36e4-45fd-87a8-ecaaab2e5c85,It would be nice if the item specifics and description were both visible without having to scroll down and click a link. Also if some sort of description and price were shown when you're searching for something. And there little list of related items a lot of times is way off and has nothing in relation to what you were looking at to begin with. Somewhat tricky site navigation and misleading sales tactics always check how much the shipping is going to be,3,negative

468,c4f58b95-645b-4223-b8c0-659d952d01f1,"Dude this generation loves achievement hunting, you can't deny it, especially when there's real incentive. You literally get rewarded for shopping. Buy stuff, get points, write review, get points etc. Spend points for discounts and keep shopping. Be wary of item quality, listen to reviews (easily accessible on the product page) not everything is name brand but a lot of it is priced wicked cheap and still works like it's supposed to, I can't hide the fact that the market is hella saturated with imitation stuff. Some junk, some totally worth it. Got my gf a noise cancelling headset, super comfy, good sound quality for just under $17. If you know how to check sources, cross-reference and judge the presentation of products/merchants, there's no reason not to dive in with confidence.",5,positive
