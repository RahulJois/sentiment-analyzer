There is a button specifically for that? So now you can't see 2 items you like and add them both to a list without screenshotting and then searching for the second. Also can't add an item to multiple lists. Why would you change functionality from web to mobile? Only good for tracking orders... if they wouldn't send you 3 emails for each order you place.
