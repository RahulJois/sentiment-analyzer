The biggest problems however are not with the app itself but rather with aliexpress as a whole, namely the wholesale keyword slamming that is endemic throughout the store thus making it much harder to find what you actually want. This must surely hurt their sales as I often give up on a search when the results are just worthless due to this constant and excessive keyword spamming. An additional problem which is occurring with rapidly increasing frequency is the price baiting, a search will return results but when selecting one it will inevitably show a selection of prices with the cheapest usually ""out of stock‚Äù, or the cheapest price is just an accessory, not the actual item you were looking for.

they're unable to ship or due to increase in price they don't want to ship. 
Instead, they update the fake shipping details by mentioning the fake n 
fictitious tracking no. of some bloody Flyt Express. If buyer is not smart 
to check and find that item is not even picked up and doesn't file a 
dispute, these crooked sellers will coolly sit back and watch. If buyer is 
smart enough and files a refund dispute on the 11th day of the so called 
shipping(as per AliExpress rules), these rougue sellers immediately accept 
refund request and deaf, dumb n blind AliExpress treat it as settlement 
between buyer n seller. Therefore buyer can't leave any feedback for the 
seller. It is very important - 1. To start tracking the shipment especially 
till it leaves China. 2. Always make unboxing video while opening the 
parcel received from Chinese sellers. Otherwise AliExpress will not 
entertain your claim if item is missing or damaged or if different item has 
been sent by the seller. 3. One must immediately leave feedback first even 
before opening the dispute and put all the photos with it. 4. When making a 
video then keep it in mind that it shouldn't be of more then 2 minutes else 
you will not be able to upload it. 5. Some fraud n cheat sellers will go to 
extent of asking you to accept refund thru your PayPal account. NEVER EVER 
ACCEPT TO HAVE REFUND THRU YOUR PAYPAL ACCOUNT YOU WILL LOOSE YOUR MONEY AS 
SELLER WILL SAY THAT HE HAS TRANSFERRED BUT PAYPAL WILL DENIE RECEIVING ANY 
REFUND FROM SELLER. 6. NEVER accept seller's request to change your dispute 
from NOT RECEIVED ITEM to RETURN & REFUND. He will ask you to change 
dispute and then choose 'YES' for having received the item and then file 
chose personal reason for return n refund. Just imagine how that bustard 
wants to fool you. When you've not received the item and tracking is a 
proof still he wants you to tell AliExpress that you have received the 
item. What will you do if later he rejects your demand of return n refund. 
You won't be able to leave any feedback for such a bastard.. There are some 
real good and very nice n honest sellers also on AliExpress. I have all the 
regards for them. But like one rotton egg spoils the whole lot, similarly 
few fraud n cheat sellers are bringing bad name to AliExpress as a whole. 
It's time for Jack Ma and other senior officials to take note of the fake 
shipping details by sellers only to escape the penalties from AliExpress 
but in the process waste precious time of buyer. Jack Ma is black belt in
