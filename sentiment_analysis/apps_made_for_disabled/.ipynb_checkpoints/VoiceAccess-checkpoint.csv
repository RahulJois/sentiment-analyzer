For safety's sake, she needs to use the phone with her voice at any time. Unfortunately, the app is super glitchy and stops working often. It requires a reboot which she obviously cannot do. You can't even access Google Assistant when this happens. Pixel 2 design even interferes with it's own app - black rectangle at top covers the text readout bar.",4,negative

Unfortunately The Voice access app will start listening to you and we'll never stop, and you will pick up your phone from your pocket 20 minutes later and realise it's been listening to you and typing out all your words and conversations this entire time. an absolute total invasion of what I wanted to be listened to. (I'm not removing the dictation typos). Dictation and voice control has a long way to go at Google. Just give me a qwerty keyboard back so I never have to talk to my phone again. The touch screen is the dumbest and most clumsiest idea for input.",2,negative
