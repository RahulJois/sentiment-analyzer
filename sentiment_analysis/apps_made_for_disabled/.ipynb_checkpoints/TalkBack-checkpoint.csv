Just like when I updated my talkback to 12.2, it also gave the option to read the picture which only reads the picture in English language. This English language does not work well in any device so It should be improved and two more languages ‚Äã‚Äãshould be arranged to read the picture. We want English as well as Urdu and Hindi to be added.",5,positive

For two more stars I offer the following suggestion. For the longest time talkback has had difficulty buffering large amounts of text. Example: when I am going through my inbox I hear the thumnales but if it's a large amount of text there is a pause when I flick to it or touch it for about 1 to two seconds and then it reads the thumbnale. I found a great phone for blind people to use called the Cat S22. it's a flipphone with an actual keyboard buttons and also has a touch screen. It has 2GB of ram and 16 GB of sorage. Apps run really well but talkback can really slow the thing down. Can you please fix this? I am running android 11 Go and when talkback is off it's really snappy but once it gets turned on things get sluggish. This is also true on the web. Android has turned in to a really serious operating system and one worthy of recommending. Talkback is on the right track. Fixing this long standing bug will really make it shine. Please, have a look at this. The Cat S22 is a wonderful hibrid phone which serves the people who want buttons and the folks who want the touch screen android experience. I'm really looking forward to a snappy update that addresses this issue. Thanks.",3,positive

For example: 1. Talkback must have the swipe or gestures to do action shortcuts on managing, sending and receiving emails like reply, forward and delete. 2.

You need to add AI for picture recognition; you have the largest image library, but it has translated into very few dividends for AI work in terms of photo recognition. I want photo recognition on Instagram stories or for my photo gallery. What about text recognition. What about some real copy and paste features. What about improving braille support? What about adding the ability to determine attributes such as fonts and bolding?

The beep is very important because without it you don't know if it's working. Turing on switch access automatically turns on TalkBack which is now called the accessibility suite. There are multiple problems with this. First of all it disables the volume buttons. I don't know why you would ever want to disable buttons in a menu you have to dig in so many layers deep to change. It's not even called disable volume buttons. I had to search on a forum to find out what the problem is. Also you can't just leave everything on and forget about it because TalkBack/accessibility fundamentally changes the operation of your phone. It will read everything aloud and you have to double tap on things to activate/deactivate them. However my main issue is that when you turn on switch access the Google accessibility suite is always opening it's stupid set up wizard. I will be in another app or writing a text or something and the stupid wizard will decide to open over what I'm doing. I turn it off a hundred times a day and it wants to open. I've tried going through the wizard, etc. It still wants to open all the time. This might sound like a small thing, but it's ridiculous that in order to use my phone like in the commercial I have to turn on switch access, turn on TalkBack but disable it, and then all throughout the day swipe away the accessibility set up wizard. I've spoken to Google technical support multiple times and all they do is send me refurbished phones with the same issues. I don't believe they are working on a fix to this problem. Google software like Google maps and Google photos are great, the capabilities of Google Assistant are amazing, but none of that matters because their OS is broken and they aren't interested in fixing it.",1,negative

2508,acc8d8ba-69f2-44ef-b7f7-390fb6b2e20a,"to the people that are complaining about this being bloatware, you some common sense.. Android does a lot of things that are intermingled with each other such as responding to your voice, as well as telling you information. You may have noticed the ""hey Google"" feature. Yes, believe it or not certain features can have multiple functions. Stop wasting people's time by complaining about things you don't understand. Regarding actually using the app, the select to speak feature has always hurt me. I do not understand why it has to freeze my entire screen when in use. I use it very regularly, and if there is text that overlaps into another page, the feature will continue reading text continuously (as it should) but by freezing my entire screen from finger input, I can no longer follow along with the text that is now off screen. so for this I downloaded a third party app that has been able to do this for quite some time now. another very strange thing with this new (and very unnecessary) name change, the 'Cast' quick access tile in the extended notification menu no longer calls itself cast, but has the name of this accessibility package instead. Even more weird, The Cast icon is constantly engaged as though my phone is casting to some place. (and since Google removed the simplest one line of code that allowed the Miracast protocol to work (for no reason other than to spite loyal users like me) in order to bump sales of your less functional ChromeCast product, I can safely say that I never use that cast option. Why is it showing that Cast is currently running but with the title of Android Accessibility Suite below the icon? I guess this is what happens when you try to Blackmail your clients into buying useless products. this is probably some other convoluted conspiracy to get me to buy a Chromecast (that I will never buy because it is a far inferior to any Miracast product made earlier in this decade)... yes I'm venting.. Cuz I'm frustrated that Google is becoming apple with these stupid tactics of purposefully disabling support for products from other manufacturers. if you need artificial sales numbers to bolster a certain product, that product is a failure.",3,negative

Have the action have consistent results, instead of working AT times) Make it less difficult. Simplicity is key for any impairment. This app is not simple. Its too complex.

And to all those who have mentioned that talkback as irritating should have been outdated with technology for not knowing the value of it.

He tried this app on my phone and it seems like it COULD be a good app but it needs a lot of work. It's glitchy and a little more difficult than it should be for a person that cannot see. I suggest having a group of blind people test the app for you and let you know what would make it easier for them. Android would have a lot more blind users if you fixed this app.,3,positive

It has evolved considerably over the years, and now has overcome a crisis of stagnation that had gripped it last year. The communication has improved between the developer team and the users, there again are regular updates. The latest stable release of TalkBack has introduced lots of new features though a lot of them may not be available to user with phones below Android 4.3. Yet, the customization of gestures and additional options to customize the display of menu items are all fabulous.

3994,f2faa335-bebd-4f20-bf6f-db20615cd002,"The way Talkback handles onscreen keyboard is either broken or demential.  When you tap on a letter once, nothing happens. It neither reads it loud nor input it. Then, when you *double*tap ANYWHERE, it will write the last letter you single-tapped, (regardless of where you are double-tapping)  and  echo it.  For example: if you tab a, b, c, d, e, each once, you get nothing (nothing written, nothing echoed). Then you double-tap on x, y, z, and even backspace, and you'll end up writing ""eeee"".  In order to write ""home"" you have to: tap ""h"", double-tap anywhere; tap ""o"", double-tap anywhere; tap ""m"", double-tap anywhere; tap ""e"", double-tap anywhere. That would kind of make sense (far from optimal but kind of consistent with the general behavior of TalkBack) if it read the letter when you tap it the first time, but it doesn't!! Only after the double tap, when the letter is input, do you listen what you typed. So the first single tap, which is mandatory, is completely useless.

Four stars ask it's useful for the intended purpose. e.g. You can't see the screen. Headphones help. Needs a better tutorial and the occasional crash is a bit annoying. The main trick to using it is dragging your finger around the screen and the tapping quickly anywhere on the screen to get it to open what's selected. If you expect to want to turn it off often (or at all) it might be a good idea to put a settings shortcut widget to accessibility on the home screen first.
