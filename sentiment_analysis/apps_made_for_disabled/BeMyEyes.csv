0,943165c6-6c54-4362-b298-86a4d7bdf260,Hi I am been active since more than 6 months. The purpose of creating this app is good and impressive. But I come across that one user is misusing this app and he himself has portrating as blind person. I know the case is negligible compared to the benefits received by number of persons . But my intension is that the objective of creating this app should not deviate or misuse. Since many volunteers are supporting voluntuarly and should not feel absurd about this noble cause.,5,positive

BTW in the visually impaired category, and not visually impaired category it should be an option to say if you are colour blind, because colour blind people need help too",4,negative

I'm a volunteer, and it's so good to see that the number of volunteers VS the number of blind users is so much higher - proof that there is good in this world. It's super easy to use, you answer the video call and the video chat starts. Since there are so many volunteers, you won't answer that many calls, so every now and then, make sure you're still logged in.",5,negative

11,e3bad4ac-4d63-41c6-baa8-1d9e6c86b275,"Although I appreciate this service and have helped people with this app, I feel this app is lacking in the ability to choose the hours of availability making it limited to only some people who need assistance or are willing to offer assistance.

What about people who work overnight hours and need assistance or want to be available to help someone during the night?",3,positive

no longer able to work, volunteer, or even leave the house much. This is a 
wonderful opportunity for me to feel useful again. I have become aware of 
so many horrible things about our world and been so let down by so many 
things I had such faith in before. My search for answers to my health 
problems has opened my eyes to how truly disgusting human beings can be. 
Discovering this app has restored a bit of hope in me today. I really 
needed it. So, THANK YOU!! From the bottom of my heart to all who had a 
hand in creating this, thank you! You are not only helping the blind to 
see, you are helping all of us to see more kindness which is very much

429,dbe98859-5966-4940-8cf0-b9dddaaaef80,"New to the ""Be My Eyes"" app, so haven't received a call yet, but giving the 
concept five stars and then some! As a volunteer my only complaint, like 
many others listed, is that we cannot set our own call times. For instance, 
the app calls most people during the volunteer's daylight hours from 8 an 
to 9 pm...rather than the volunteer's ""awake and available"" hours. So for 
instance, if a blind user in the US needs assistance and in their own time 
zone it is 2:00 am in the morning...it would be considered the middle of 
the night for most volunteers in the US. So instead of a volunteer in the 
US getting a call, the call would be routed to volunteers on the other side 
of the world who would normally be awake in the ""daytime hours"". My 
problem, as a volunteer, is that I am a night person in the US. So calls 
may be routed to me during the day when I am sleeping and unavailable to 
respond. And calls from the other side of the world won't come to me when I 
am awake at night, because of the ""only call in day hours from 8 am to 9 
pm"" policy. So I may never get to respond to calls for help, but I am 
willing and able! I look forward to being of assistance. I can usually 
accept calls from 2:00 PM to 7:00 am Pacific Standard Time, and would love 
to be a voice in the night to help others! Just make the app able to allow 
users to set their own availability and then I'd give 10 stars if I could! 
Please add this option to the development of the app? The only other issue 
I can see a problem with is that a user is not supposed to put medical info 
or medication info out to a volunteer and volunteers are asked not to help 
with such. On the one hand....I can understand this, as that could be a 
serious liability for developers and volunteers to take on, if something 
were to go wrong. And there ARE actually bad people out there who could do 
harm to others in regards to medication taking. But on the other hand, if I 
were blind and taking medications I would certainly want to know that there 
was someone in the middle of the night that could help me with such....for 
instance, if I dropped my medications and needed help sorting them again, 
or if I needed help reading a prescription label for correct dosage or even 
to relabel it in Braille, or to read safety precautions on over the counter 
medications, to tell me if a medication was expired before taking it. So 
it's got it's good points and bad, there's no way around that really except 
to make the rule of not asking for help with such and not giving help on 
such, but that's unfortunate. Other than those two things.....what a GREAT 
service the inventer/developer has offered to world. Your generous heart is 
a rare kindness and I, for one, thank you for your foresight and altruism.

436,17671dce-e110-4195-97ed-c7755634edde,"This is an exceptional idea for an app. It's also well executed overall. 
The app works as advertised, and the selection of languages impressed me (I 
was pleasantly surprised to see even Esperanto included!). The only 
downside is the extreme rarity of receiving a call as a volunteer. It seems 
new volunteers often get a call within the first day - probably to keep 
them interested - but after that calls are few and far between. I received 
one call on my first day, but it was answered by another volunteer before I 
could get it. After that I received no calls for a couple weeks despite 
keeping the app running 24/7. Yesterday I finally received another call, 
which I answered. It seems much more promotion among the blind/vision 
impaired community is needed to help even out the numbers and so that even 
more people can be helped. Still, the app is an amazing resource for those 
who use it, and I'll keep it installed for those rare times when I may be 
available to assist quicker than anyone else. As someone who routinely 
relies on help from others due to health issues, it's nice to be able to 
help others once in awhile, too.",4,negative
