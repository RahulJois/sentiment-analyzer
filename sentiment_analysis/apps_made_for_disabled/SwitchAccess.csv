If you have to please open up in public why should your consumer have to download it irrespective of having Android Accessibility Suit application. Interesting thing is once you give permission it looks like the consumer a given permission of screen sharing and and there is no control pannel for it . I tried to disable the app but it is not happening,1,negative
